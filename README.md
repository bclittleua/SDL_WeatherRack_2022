# SDL_WeatherRack_2022

My effort to get an old SDL Weather Rack kit working after sitting in a box for 5+ years.


Uh, the kit was sitting in a box for 5+ years, not me. I was definitely sitting, but not for the whole time and definitely not in a box...


weatherreader.py is just for terminal display and keeps no logs

weatherwriter.py does log, but does not display to terminal
